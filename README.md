This is a simple Java implementation of a UNO-style card game designed to showcase object-oriented programming (OOP) and basic data structure (DS) skills.

## Features

- Randomized deck and card drawing
- Game loop handling player turns
- Win detection based on empty hands
- Basic input error handling

## Technologies
- Java (Console Application)

## How to Run

3. Run the program: java Main

## Future Improvements (Phase 2 Ideas)
